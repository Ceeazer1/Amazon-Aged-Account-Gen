## How It works:

a program that scrapes emails from
http://www.fakemailgenerator.com/
And goes though each email to see
if the email is registered on amazon
and to see if the account can be recovered.

 The only thing you have to do is to press forget password
and enter the opt from the email/website.
No more wasting time going though each email to see if
its recoverable. Now its automated.
